# Portfolio Analytics Dashboard

A comprehensive full-stack portfolio tracking and analytics platform built with Node.js/Express backend and Next.js frontend.
this is created and submitted as a part of assignment for Wealthmanager.online for Full-Stack Developer Intern position.

## My Contribution

Contribution made by me : 
1. updated the complete frontend UI generated by ai as per the looks of official website of Wealthmanager as I liked the theme alot as It resembles their website.
(Updates code sections of MY CONTRIBUTIONS : globalcss, tailwind cinfig, layout file, theme provider, components : holdings, top performers sevctions , loader etc, main page.tsx)

2. updated the backend generic code which i first explained to Ai what to be build how i want it and what response we need and how api endpoints will be treated for response.
a. optimized efficiency of backend by understanding a generic code and there I found a common reusable code which for proper logic and efficiency i moved and rewrote it to middleware.js. It calculates the metrics and attaches them to the req object, making the data available to the actual endpoint logic without recalculating.
impacts of this : 
efficient
proper code structure as per DRY rules (Do not repeat you code again and again)

## Features

### Backend API
- **Holdings Management**:  This function right here helps to handle the one holding finincial state and do its maths.
- **Asset Allocation**: Sole purpose of this endpoint is to show how your portfolio's value segregation is done. for ex total portfolio value is 100000
so this api results in value dostributed across different sectors and market caps.
- **Performance Tracking**:GET /api/portfolio/performance gets data for performance chart (historic data and comparison).
- **Portfolio Summary**:  getting overall nuymbers of entire portfolio of individuals. calculates currentVale, totalgainlosspercentage, sorts on basis of totalgainlosspercentage. finally finds the top performer.
diversificationScore shows how many unique sectors you're invested in.
